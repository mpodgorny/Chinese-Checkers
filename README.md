# Chinese Checkers

The objective is to be first to race all of one's pieces across the hexagram-shaped board into "home"—the corner of the star opposite one's starting corner—using single-step moves or moves that jump over other pieces [*(wiki source)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_checkers). 

Made in client-server architecture in Java (SDK 8) using javaFX.
